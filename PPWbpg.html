        <h2>First Week of studying two different fields </h2>
        <h5> <i> how I tackle thefirst week being both in the university and bootcamp</i>, March 4, 2023</h5>

        <p> As a medical student, my schedule was already packed with lectures, practicals, and clinical rotations. However, I decided to challenge myself by attending a coding boot camp to expand my skill set and learn more about programming.

            Juggling both medical school and a coding boot camp was not easy, and I had to be highly organized and disciplined with my time management. I would wake up early each day to complete my medical school work and attend classes, then spend my evenings and weekends at the coding boot camp. It often meant sacrificing social events and leisure activities, but I was determined to keep up with both commitments.
            
            Despite the demanding schedule, I persevered and is learning a great deal about programming. I was surprised to discover that the skills I recquired in the coding boot camp were transferable to my medical studies, as data analysis and programming are becoming increasingly important in the field.</p>
